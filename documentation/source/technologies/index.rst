Technology Stack and Motivation
===============================

This part of the documentation is dedicated to explaining which technologies were used for the development of the application and the motivation behind the chosen technologies.

Python - Cherrypy
-----------------

Cherrypy was selected for its blend of simplicity, performance, and user-friendliness. Beyond its ease of use, it provides robust tools for handling HTTP requests, sessions, and static files, making it an ideal choice for building our web application.

Docker
------

Docker was implemented to ensure seamless deployment across diverse environments, enhancing scalability and fostering collaborative development efforts.

AWS
---

Leveraging AWS brought scalability, reliability, and a suite of services crucial for our application's development. Notably, services like EC2 for hosting, S3 for storage, and Cognito for user authentication played pivotal roles in shaping the application's infrastructure.

LocalStack
----------

LocalStack proved invaluable by replicating core functionalities of AWS services within a local environment. This emulation capability accelerated development cycles and streamlined debugging processes, empowering our team to iterate more efficiently.

Vite
----

Vite was adopted for its robust support of contemporary JavaScript features and streamlined build processes. Its rapid iteration capabilities, coupled with optimized builds, expedited development workflows, thereby enhancing productivity and code quality.

Sphinx
------
Sphinx was integrated seamlessly into the project due to its deep compatibility with Python ecosystems. Beyond its integration prowess, Sphinx offered advanced documentation features such as cross-referencing, automatic indexing, and extensibility via plugins, ensuring comprehensive and well-maintained project documentation.
